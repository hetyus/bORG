**Project:** Korg Modwave MKI keyboard â†’ Arduino Pro Micro USB-MIDI controller

This firmware turns the Korg Modwave MKI keybed into a class-compliant USB-MIDI controller
with velocity curves, calibration, SysEx configuration, and EEPROM storage.

Who the hell would need this anyway?
Well, it only makes sense if youâ€™ve converted the Korg Modwave into a module and youâ€™re left with a bare keybed that you couldnâ€™t use without a "brain".

## Features
- Velocity-sensitive scanning with selectable curves  
- SysEx configuration (curve, calibration, fixed velocity, factory reset, status)  
- NoteOff velocity support  
- EEPROM save/load of settings  

---

## Installation
1. Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.  
2. Select **Arduino Pro Micro (ATmega32U4)** as board.  
3. Upload to your device.

## Usage
Connect via USB. The device will show up as a MIDI controller.  
Configuration can be changed via SysEx messages (see documentation).

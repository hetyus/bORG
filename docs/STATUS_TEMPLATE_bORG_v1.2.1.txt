Project: bORG v1.2.1 â€“ dtguard + USE_ADS switch
Repo: https://github.com/hetyus/bORG
Current sketch: bORG_v1_2_1_ADSswitch_fix16e_dtguard_clean_USE_ADS_minpatch.ino

Goal:
- Stable velocity handling with minimal spikes.
- ADS1115 joystick support controllable via USE_ADS flag.
- Maintain compatibility with FN shortcuts and SysEx controls.

Current status:
- Base sketch compiles and runs with USE_ADS=0.
- Note On/Off events confirmed working (USB-MIDI).
- Velocity stable for single notes; spikes remain on chord presses.
- FN and SysEx functionality assumed unchanged (needs re-check).

Open issues:
- Velocity spikes during multi-key presses.
- Occasional high velocity on soft presses.
- Black keys output ~30% higher velocity than white keys.
- Calibration for repeatable velocity still under investigation.

Next steps:
- Test with USE_ADS=1 once ADS1115 is connected.
- Experiment with COL_SETTLE_US and MIN_DT_TICKS to reduce chord spikes.
- Validate FN shortcuts and SysEx commands against Quick Reference.
- Plan possible return to v1.1 logic if pairing/spike issues persist.
